== 1.0.1 / 2007-12-02

* Added 'using_namespace' directive for assuming a module for a group of object defs
* Added 'use_class_directly' option for configuring an ObjectDef.  Instead of instantiating an instance
  of the specified class, the class itself is referenced.  (Good for injecting ActiveRecord classes into 
  other components in the guise of factories.
* Added DIY::Context.auto_require boolean setting. When false, the library of a
  class is not autoloaded ahead of object construction. Is true by default.
* 'auto_require' can, if neccessary, be set in the YAML config for an individual object. 

== 1.0.0 / 2007-11-19

* Released!
